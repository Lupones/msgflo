[c-base](https://c-base.org) is a crashed space station under Berlin, Germany that acts as one of the world's oldest hackerspaces.

The various artifacts and systems of c-base communicate over a MQTT network coordinated by MsgFlo. This allows seeing the overall information flow visually in [Flowhub](https://flowhub.io) as well as repurposing systems by changing how they're connected.

The c-base MsgFlo setup can be found from <https://github.com/c-base/c-flo>.
